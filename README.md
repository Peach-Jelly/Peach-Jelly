- 👋 Hi, I’m @Peach-Jelly!

- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my **Master's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance**. I have the **Sec+**, **Net+**, **A+**, **CFR**, and **ISC2 CC** and am currently studying for my CySA+, Cloud+ and PenTest+!

- 💞️ I have limited programming experience, but it really intrigues me! Even though I probably won't be specializing in programming for my career, I'll probably be poking around with coding for fun as a hobby, trying to learn new things. :]

I learned **HTML** back in high school (and even got a scholarship for it), but that was over ten years ago, and I only really remember the basic stuff! Whew... I just made myself feel old. ( o.o);

Recently, I became more intrigued with programming languages thanks to a game called Else Heart.Break(), which has become one of my all-time favorite games. It's a game about "hacking" the town various elements to solve the game's puzzles... and ironically I figured out how to edit the game files themselves, thus "hacking" the game about hacking. And the whole process was incredibly fun. I even made a guide about it on Steam. ^_^;;

And recently I've been learning some shell scripting and making **bash** scripts in my **Ubuntu Linux** distro, some of which I may share here!

And right now I'm playing a game called BitBurner which is letting me practice writing **JS** scripts.

Aaaaaanyway, TLDR: I don't know much programming yet, but I think it's fun, and I'd like to learn more. :]
