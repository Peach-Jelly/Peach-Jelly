- 👋 Hi, I’m @Peach-Jelly

- 🌱 I’m currently studying for a CompTIA Network+ certification and plan to pursue a new career in I.T. very soon!

- 💞️ I have very limited programming experience, but it really intrigues me! Even though I probably won't be specializing in programming for my career, I'll probably be poking around with coding for fun as a hobby, trying to learn new things. :]

I learned HTML back in high school (and even got a scholarship for it), but that was over ten years ago, and I only really remember the basic stuff! Whew... I just made myself feel old. ( o.o);

Recently, I became more intrigued with programming languages thanks to a game called Else Heart.Break(), which has become one of my all-time favorite games. It's a game about "hacking" the town various elements to solve the game's puzzles... and ironically I figured out how to edit the game files themselves, thus "hacking" the game about hacking. And the whole process was incredibly fun. I even made a guide about it on Steam. ^_^;;

Aaaaaanyway, TLDR: I don't know much programming yet, but I think it's fun, and I'd like to learn more. :]
